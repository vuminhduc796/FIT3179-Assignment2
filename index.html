            <p> This visualisation used choropleth map to indicate the normalized confirmed
                cases by a million people. The darker color will represent the higher density
                of coronavirus patients. As can be seen from the graph, although the virus started
                spreading from Asia, the heaviest effected countries were United States and Brazil.
                Moreover, due to the fact that China and India are overpopulated, the total cases per a
                million of people were low. It is interesting to see the diversity of values in Africa,
                while some countries were maintaining a low number of cases, the other such as Libra and
                South Africa were struggling to control the spread of this decease. Overall, Europe
                countries were having relatively high figures. The data is last updated on 24/10/2020
                 and visualiszed on 27/10/2020. Filter for minimum population was encoded.

            <p>This visualisation demonstrates the total cases of each country, encoded with different 
                colors representing the continent. Although in the first graph, a majority of <span style="color: #e6d4a3">Oceania</span> countries
                were having high total of cases by million of people, the total confirmed cases remained low.
                The identitcal trends are also applied for <span style="color: #ed8b85">Africa</span> and <span style="color: #c90c0c">Europe</span>. <span style="color: #e6550d">Asia</span> and <span style="color: #7a1f1a">America</span> were having the 
                most confirmed cases due to the dense and high population. Brazil and United States contributed
                over half on total cases in <span style="color: #7a1f1a">America</span> while India is currently dominating in <span style="color: #e6550d">Asia</span>. On the other hand,
                the total number of confirmed cases in <span style="color: #c90c0c">Europe</span> is equally divided to many countries, represented as
                many rectangles with identical areas. Lastly, South Africa were having the most confirmed cases in 
                <span style="color: #ed8b85">Africa</span>, followed by <strong>Morocco </strong>.

        <p>In this Sankey diagram, we visualised the outcome of Covid-19 decease by continent. This visualisation focused
            on how each continent encountered Coronavirus. As can be seen from the diagram,  <span style="color: #7a1f1a">America</span> has the highest number
            of cases, more than half of those are still active. The total of deaths from <span style="color: #7a1f1a">America</span> is the highest, comparing to
            other continents. On the other hand, while <span style="color: #e6550d">Asia</span> and <span style="color: #c90c0c">Europe</span> have comparable total of cases, <span style="color: #e6550d">Asia</span> is still in the
            emergency stage as most of the cases are still active. <span style="color: #c90c0c">Europe</span> is recovering from the decease, the total number of
            recovered cases is high, comparing to other continents. The total of death cases globally remaining low as a good
            sign. Almost half of the confirmed cases resulted in recovery, while more than half of the cases are still active.
            Lastly, <span style="color: #e6d4a3">Oceania</span> and <span style="color: #ed8b85">Africa</span> are still doing well, stopping the spread of Covid-19.

           <p>This visualisation provides the comparison between different age groups and genders on total of infected cases in Australia.
                It can be observed from the chart that people between 20-39 years old have the highest risk of infection.
             When it comes to comparison between male and female, although the patterns are quite similar, female is having higher recorded
            cases than male. Female at 79+ age group had unexpectedly high number of cases.  </p>

            We can see that although White people has the highest percentage in population, their contribute towards total cases
            and deaths are decreasing. Black/ African and Asian had similar values for all categories.

               This area chart represents the growth of Covid-19 cases by the top 10 affected countries. The dataset was collected
               from March 2020 to September 2020. We can see clearly that the US, India and Brazil are having the highest number of
               cases respectively. Followed up by Russia and Colombia. It is noticeable that the total number of cases dramatically
                increased in July 2020. The total recorded cases contributed from the top 10 countries was nearly 23 millions in 
                September.

    <h2> The Covid-19 Outcome by Country</h2>

          <div class="description description-left">
            <p> In this bubble plot, we can see how each country encounters Covid-19, indicated by the total of deaths and the 
                total of recovered cases. Each country is represented as a dot, with encoded size for the total cases and color
                for continent. A country that does well will have high number of recoveries but low number of deaths. 
                Although Brazil and United States had comparable total cases, Brazil was doing better by having more recovery cases
                than the US. This graph shows an interesting fact that the death/recovery ratio was not dependent on continents, as
                the colors are well-mixed in the middle of the graph. It is reasonable that countries with higher number of total cases
                will have higher number of deaths and recoveries.
